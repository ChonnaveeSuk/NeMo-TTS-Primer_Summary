Ground Truth Aligned (GTA) Inference Analysis
=========================================

Input text: That is not only my accusation.

Processing Steps:
1. Regular Inference: Generate audio directly from text
2. GTA Inference: Use ground truth audio to guide generation
3. Compare outputs to understand teacher forcing effects

Audio sample rate: 22050 Hz
Audio duration: 1.93 seconds
Processing device: cuda

Output Files:
1. simulated_original.wav - Simulated ground truth audio
2. gta_synthesis.wav - Audio generated using GTA inference
3. regular_synthesis.wav - Audio generated using regular inference
